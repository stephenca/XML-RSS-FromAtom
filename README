DESCRIPTION
    XML::RSS::FromAtom converts a Atom style feed into an XML::RSS object.

ATTRIBUTES
    syndicator
        An instance of a class that will parse the chosen Atom feed. By
        default, this is XML::Atom::Syndication, but it can be any class
        that exposes an equivalent interface.

    rss_processor
        An instance of a class that will hold the converted Atom feed as
        RSS. By default, this will be XML::RSS.

    content
        The Atom feed represented as a string. This will normally be
        populated by a call to the parse() method.

METHODS
    new( )
        Instanciates a new XML::RSS::FromAtom object

    parse( $string )
        Parses contents of $string as an Atom feed (using
        XML::Atom::Syncdication) and returns it as an XML::RSS object.

    atom_to_rss ( $object )
        Converts an XML::Atom::Syndication::Element as returned by
        XML::Atom::Syndication get into an XML::RSS object.

    build_rss_processor ()
        Provides a default implementation for the rss_processor attribute.

    build_syndicator ()
        Provides a default implementation for the syndicator attribute.
